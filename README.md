# Nix Proton CachyOS

A Nix flake for [CachyOS Proton](https://github.com/CachyOS/proton-cachyos), a compatibility tool for Steam Play based on Wine with additional patches and optimizations from CachyOS.

## Usage

Add to your NixOS configuration:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    # Your other inputs...
    nix-proton-cachyos.url = "github:kimjongbing/nix-proton-cachyos";
  };
}
```

Then add it to your Steam configuration:

```nix
# In your Steam configuration (e.g., configuration.nix or steam.nix)
programs.steam = {
  enable = true;
  extraCompatPackages = [
    inputs.nix-proton-cachyos.packages.${system}.proton-cachyos
  ];
};
```

After rebuilding your system, you should see "Proton-CachyOS" in Steam's compatibility tools list (Steam -> Settings -> Compatibility).

## Updates
